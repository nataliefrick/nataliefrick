### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my account! This account holds current and [soon] past projects.

Currently projects are for the  <br>
Mid Sweden University web-development program, <br>
*[Mittuniversitetet Webbutvecklings-programmet]*, 
2021-2023.

âš¡ My life story in a few sentences: I am a 40-something married mother of two boys living in Ã–stersund Sweden. I have lived in 3 countries, have dual-citizenship, have visited/vacationed in at least 25 countries, mostly in Europe. On my wishlist is South America, Austrailia, and New Zealand. Coding and webdesign is my third career. I started out as a Structural Engineer working with roads, then ran a photography business for 10 years specializing in weddings and babies and now I work with the web. I offer my clients Wordpress websites but wished to know the code behind, so now am studying webdesign. I started at Blekinge Teknisk HÃ¶gskola and was on my way to complete the first year when Corona hit. It derailed my studies, but have now recieved my degree in Web Developement from Mid Sweden University in Ã–stersund, Sweden.
