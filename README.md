### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my account! This account holds current and [soon] past projects.

Currently projects are for the  <br>
Mid Sweden University web-development program, <br>
*[Mittuniversitetet Webbutvecklings-programmet]*, 
2021-2023.



ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP.

âš¡ My life story in a few sentences: I am a 40-something married mother of two boys living in Ã–stersund Sweden. I have lived in 3 countries, have 2 nationalities, have visited/vacationed in at least 25 countries, mostly in Europe. On my wishlist is South America, Austrailia, and New Zealand. Coding and webdesign is my third career. I started out as a Structural Engineer working with roads, then ran a photography business for 10 years specializing in weddings and babies and now I work with the web. I offer my clients Wordpress websites but wished to know the code behind, so now am studying webdesign. I started at Blekinge Teknisk HÃ¶gskola and was on my way to complete the first year when Corona hit. It derailed my studies, but now I am back on track, working my way through the first year of MIUNs program instead.
