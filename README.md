### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
As an engaged full-stack developer with strong planning skills and a talent for problem-solving, I thrive in both customer-facing roles and team settings. I appreciate work that allows me to collaborate closely with clients to create digital solutions that enhance the customer experience or solve their challenges through digital design and web development. With excellent organizational skills and the ability to coordinate and communicate effectively with various stakeholders, I contribute to successful projects and satisfied customers.

I am looking for collaborations with small businesses, web agencies, and larger companies to help and support them in their projects, whether through project-based employment, freelancing, or full-time employment.
